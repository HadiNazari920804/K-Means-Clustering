*Improving customer clustering using the K-means algorithm by adding more features to the RFM model*

# About me
I'm Hadi Nazari. As a data enthusiast who is really passionate about diving into complex data and translating them into value-adding insights, I'd like to 
share my understandings with you.

## Project Intro/Objective
Every customer is different and every customer journey is different, so a single approach often isn’t going to work for all. So, customer segmentation is an effective tool for businesses to closely align their strategy and tactics with, and better target, their current and future customers. But, first and fore most you have to answer to following questions:
* What features should be considered for customer segmentation?
* What algorithm works best to separate different clusters of customers?
* How many customers clusters do you have?
* How can you improve your model?

## Key messages 
* Collecting customers sales history data
* Extracting important feature to model. 
* Dealing with missing values and outliers
* Evaluation of different methods including scaled or original data
* Clustering customers

### Results / Recommended decisions
* Clustering customers in 4 groups

## About Dataset
- Data of sales history in a sales and distribution company
- 811016 rows – 6 features

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- data visualization
- writeup/reporting

## Project Steps

1. Data cleaning - Dealing with missing values  
2. Extract new features to use in clustering algorithm
3. Deal with missing values and outliers
4. Build a model to cluster customers
5. Evaluate different methods including scaled or original data
